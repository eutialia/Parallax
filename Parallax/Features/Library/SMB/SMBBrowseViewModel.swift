/// `SMBBrowseView` builds its own lister/`SMBFileSource` (an `AMSMB2Lister` is an actor, so it
/// can't ride the `Hashable` nav value) and tears it down on disappear.
///
/// Loading cancels any in-flight task before starting a new one; a stale-guard on the current
/// path ensures a slow, cancelled load can't overwrite the live directory. The level's path is
/// fixed for the model's lifetime, so the guard collapses to the cancellation check — but it's
/// kept explicit so the pattern remains readable. Failures map through `SMBFileSource.mapListError`
/// to the same `AppError` `userMessage` the Jellyfin grid surfaces (`LibraryGridViewModel`), so
/// SMB and Jellyfin errors read in one voice.
