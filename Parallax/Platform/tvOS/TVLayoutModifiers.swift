// tvOS layout helpers for full-bleed hero screens. tvOS reserves a title-safe / overscan inset
// on all four edges and the system applies it as the safe area, so by default ALL content —
// including full-bleed hero artwork — is pushed in from the physical screen edge. These two
// helpers form a pair: `heroScreenSafeArea()` drops the horizontal inset on the scroll
// container so the artwork can reach the edges, and `tvContentInset()` re-adds it to the
// non-hero content so focusable shelves/body stay inside the title-safe region.
// (Apple HIG "Designing for tvOS"; WWDC19 "Mastering the Living Room With tvOS".)

    /// content so it doesn't bleed into overscan too. The full-screen HEIGHT comes from
    /// `\.heroViewportHeight` (published by `measuresHeroViewport()` at the app root), and the band's

    /// feed — a server with no eligible items, or the feed call failing): the TOP bleed only

    /// its first content parks at the raw screen top, under the tvOS collapsed-sidebar pill.

    /// would double the side gutters. The detail screens keep the default: their skeleton renders
