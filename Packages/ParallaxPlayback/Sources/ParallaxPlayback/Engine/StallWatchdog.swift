/// Bounds a *mid-playback* stall, the sibling of `LoadWatchdog` (which bounds the *load*). Without
/// it, a network death after the first frame strands the player forever on the buffering scrim:
/// AVKit sits in `.waitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate` retrying a dead socket with no timeout, and VLC's
/// `player.isPlaying` reflects intent (not frames) so its poll keeps emitting `.playing` over a
/// frozen clock. The receiving end has always existed — `PlaybackError.networkStalled` maps to the
/// "The stream stalled and didn't recover…" copy — but nothing ever emitted it. This is that emitter.
///
/// Usage: `arm()` on the first `.buffering` beat (a mid-stream stall — network underrun, seek past
/// the buffer); re-`arm()` on further `.buffering` (idempotent reset of the clock); `disarm()` on any
/// transport beat (`.playing`/`.paused`), terminal state, or teardown. If neither a transport beat nor
/// a disarm arrives within `deadline`, `onExpiry` fires once on the MainActor — the engine yields
/// `.failed(.networkStalled)` so the error scrim + manual retry take over instead of an eternal spinner.
///
/// No SwiftUI/Combine (package rule): a bare `Task` + `Duration`, `@MainActor` because the engines are
/// and `onExpiry` mutates engine state. Shape mirrors `LoadWatchdog`; unlike it, `onExpiry` is bound at
/// `init` (the wiring calls bare `arm(for:)`/`disarm()` from several transport sites without re-passing
/// it) — so the SESSION travels through `arm(for:)` instead, and the expiry is handed back the session
/// whose stall it was armed on. A watchdog armed for media a reload has already replaced must not fail
/// the media that replaced it.
