/// Source-agnostic still-frame thumbnailer backed by VLCKit's `VLCMediaThumbnailer`.
/// Decodes one frame from a video `URL` (local file or `smb://`) and returns it as
/// PNG `Data` — `Sendable`, so the result crosses the package→app boundary cleanly
/// without exposing a non-`Sendable` `CGImage`/`UIImage`.
///
/// **Concurrency:** `VLCMedia`/`VLCMediaThumbnailer` are non-`Sendable`; like
/// `VLCKitEngine`, all VLC work is pinned to `@MainActor`. `VLCMediaThumbnailer`
/// delivers its delegate callbacks on the run loop of the thread that called
/// `fetchThumbnail()` (via KVO + an `NSTimer` — NOT through VLCKit's event
/// dispatcher), and that call is made from `@MainActor`, so the callbacks land on
/// the main run loop. The `nonisolated` `NSObject` delegate methods therefore assert
/// main isolation via `MainActor.assumeIsolated`. (`configureVLCEvents()` is still
/// invoked for global events-config consistency with the engine; it does NOT govern
/// thumbnailer callback threading — the `@MainActor` call site does.)
///
/// **Credentials:** `options` are applied verbatim via `media.addOption(_:)` and are
/// NEVER logged — neither are they, nor the URL, written anywhere. The thumbnailer is
/// option-agnostic; it does not know some options carry credentials (`:smb-user=…`).
///
/// **Aspect behavior (observed on vlckit-spm 4.0.0-alpha.19):** `width: 0, height: 320`
/// makes libvlc derive the width from the source aspect ratio rather than stretching to
/// a fixed box — a 160×90 (16:9) source yields a 569×320 thumbnail (1.778, exactly 16:9),
/// NOT a 320×240 4:3 frame. `width: 0` is honored, so the API defaults to it. (Downstream
/// `MediaImage` fill+crop would absorb a minor mismatch regardless.)
